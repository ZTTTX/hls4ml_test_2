# hls4ml Models
This repository contains a number of different example models implemented in [hls4ml](https://hls-fpga-machine-learning.github.io/hls4ml/)

We support translations of different machine learning/ deep learning library. Here we provide example models and secific documentations for supported features of different languages:

- [Keras](./keras-to-hls)
- [ONNX](./onnx-to-hls)
- [Pytorch](./pytorch-to-hls)

The models are a collection of various HLS projects with examples of different machine learning algorithm implementations. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with with the lastest stable `hls4ml` version.
