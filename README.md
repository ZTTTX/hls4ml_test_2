# hls4ml models
This repository contains a number of different configuration files along with example models whose translations are supported in [hls4ml](https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/).

Here we provide example models and secific documentations for supported features:

- [Keras](./keras)
- [ONNX](./onnx)
- [Pytorch](./pytorch)

The models are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with with the lastest stable `hls4ml` version. Additionally, we also provide example HLS projects that have been converted using `hls4ml` in [HLS_projects](./HLS_projects) directory.
