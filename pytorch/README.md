# Pytorch

## Model testing 

Testing with vivado 2018.2. Note that support for Pytorch right now is very limited (Currently only support fully connected architecture. ).  

- `three_layer`: all models synthesize successfully with out-of-the-box configuration. 

- `two_layer`: all models synthesize succesfullt with out-of-the-box configuration.
